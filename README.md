# Uptight's Shitty Currency Converter

Written in Lua, using LuaJIT to run. My shitty currency converter will take you on a wild spin when you look through the code.  
Over-engineered in some areas and under-engineered in others, it's sure you make you question my sanity.  

> Switched to LuaJIT because why not

## Platforms

* Windows 10/11 (Expected)
* Linux?

## Rewrites

Once I am dome with this one, I am expecting to rewrite it in C++. The original goal was to make it in C++, as the "mock-up" of this is in C++. However, I wanted to make a project in lua as it's been a long long time since I last made one.
